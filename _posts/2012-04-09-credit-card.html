  <h2>Who is Bielsystems?</h2>
  <p>We are a small software development company that sells web applications, or software that works over the internet.</p>
  <h2>Why charge my card?</h2>
  <p>
    This is a recurring charge from
    <a href='http://cobregratis.com.br'>Cobre Grátis</a>
    or a single payment of
    <a href='http://workshop.bootstrappers.com.br'>Workshop Bootstrappers</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Does not distinguish the debt?</h2>
  <p>If the names of the above products are unfamiliar to you, ask close relatives or coworkers if they charged these applications using your card.</p>
  <p>We have come to terms that 95% of the time the debt is not recognized because it was another person who contracted the service.</p>
  <h2>How do I cancel my account?</h2>
  <p>If you recognize one of the above applications and it is a recurring charge, you can cancel your account at any time. Simply log in, access the “my account tab” and click the unsubscribe account link a. Once canceled, your credit card will not be charged.</p>
  <h2>Can we get a refund?</h2>
  <p>Debits made are non-refundable, but after the account is canceled, you will no longer be charged. We do not have long-term contracts, grace periods; there is no penalty for cancellation. You only pay for what you use and can cancel at any time.</p>
  <h2>My card was cloned, what to do?</h2>
  <p>If you were a victim of fraud and your card was used by someone else, please contact us stating the type of card, the card number, date of debt and the amount charged, so that we can evaluate the case and, if fraud is confirmed, we will reverse the charged amount.</p>

  <p>One of our main goals is to guarantee your right to privacy and security of your information.</p>
  <p>So we created a privacy policy that is aimed to bring to our customers and visitors the most clear and accurate information about our methodology of work on the web.</p>
  <p>As a main rule we do not disclose any information to third parties obtained through our pages, although this could be accomplished in two situations:</p>
  <p>
    1. Court request, warrant or subpoena
    <br />
    2. Sale of the company or product
  </p>
  <p>The information we collect is directly related to the general browsing, pages visited, links clicked, schedules and any other information from our forms are available on one of our websites:</p>
  {% include produtos.html %}
  <p>Its use is linked only to the direct marketing of Bielsystems, and to establish visitor’s profiles directly targeted to offer a  more useful better tool and easier navigation.</p>
  <p>Many of our solutions require the use of cookies, and because of this reason, they are used on our pages, emphasizing once more that this is due to technical criteria only, cookies are not used to collect or spy on others who seek information or use for such third-party cookies.</p>
  <p>A cookie, also known as an http cookie, web cookie, or browser  cookie, is a piece of data stored by a website within a browser, and then subsequently sent back to the same website by the browser. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember things that a browser had done there in the past, which can include having clicked particular buttons, logging in, or having read pages on that site months or years ago.</p>
  <p>Browsers can be configured to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the opportunity to decide whether or not to accept it, however, if not accepted, some sites may not function properly.</p>
  <p>All stored information is controlled and restricted, never sold or transferred to others for any reason, even through surveys.</p>
  <p>Many of our solutions require the use of username and password; therefore none of the employees of Bielsystems are authorized to request the password of our customers regardless of the reason. Likewise, we ask when agreeing upon one of our services, that the contract is read. The client and / or visitor agrees that the use by Bielsystems of information provided pursuant to provisions herein do not imply violation of privacy or other rights related to information protection.</p>
  <p>Occasionally we send emails to our customers, according to our policy of anti-spam, and these may contain links to access our pages, but we recommend that before you clicking on the links, please stop and check on those in the bottom bar of the browser, paying close attention if the address actually refers to our page or the address described in the link. If you have questions or feel in doubt, please contact our support team before clicking the link.</p>
  <p>It is possible that our site contains links that lead to third party sites. We urge reading the privacy policy of those sites, since we are not liable for them.</p>
  <p>These sites use a web analytics service called Clicktale. Clicktale may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, scrolling activity as well as any text that you type in the sites. Clicktale does not collect personally identifiable information that is not entered voluntarily on these sites. Clicktale does not track your browsing habits on sites that do not use Clicktale services. For more information, see our privacy policy for information collected by Clicktale. We are using the information collected by Clicktale service to improve all user experiences of our applications. You can choose to disable them on Clicktale: http://www.clicktale.net/disable.html.</p>
  <p>For further information, please read our terms of use by clicking on the link on the website of each product.</p>
  <p>If you disagree with any of the above terms, please do not navigate on our site, if you accept the terms, feel free to do so.</p>
  <p>This policy is subject to change without advance notice to customers and visitors, because of the rate at which technology advances and the need to meet legal requirements.</p>
  <p>

              <strong>A important thing:</strong> Our client, André Santos, was the biggest celebrity and star on this project. As a conductor and facilitator, he have been fantastic. There is no doubt that we had a good cowork, with Andre's excellence as Product Owner and our expertise.

            <h2>SEEKING A PERFECT PARTNER: Why HE:labs?</h2>
            <p>
              Atende Simples has a very complex operation, that involves a lot of technologies, companies and systems.
              The voice platform was the responsibility of VoxAge in São Paulo.
              It was necessary to decide the best way to create our web application:
            </p>

            <ul id="topics">
              <li>Hire developers</li>
              <li>Hire freelancers</li>
              <li>Hire a development company</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The first two options had various risks:</p>
            <ul id="topics">
              <li>Would need someone to control the work of developers, putting weight on the structure early on our company.</li>
              <li>There was a possibility of creating a dependency of freelancers on a heated labor market.</li>
              <li>If a developer or freelancer leaves the project, the impact to get another one and put everything back on track would certainly be considerable.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

            <p>
              "The most important thing for Atende Simples is the user experience. Then the service price. The value has to be fair and feasible for the targeted customers. And finally, functionality. We must always be one step ahead of the customer to ensure that the service helps your business in a simple way to get success!"

            <p>For some tasks, the team had to study specifics of the application domain. O telephony back-end is a example. We were building a telephonic middleware in the cloud, and behind, the system had to be composed in large 3 blocks:</p>

            <ul id="topics">
              <li>A web interface, for the final users, where everithing must be simple. Here is where all end users of the service are related.</li>
              <li>A midfield acting as the glue between the settings that the end user does, and telephony services. This glue is a web service that runs on the same physical infrastructure of telephony, for performance reasons.</li>
              <li>The phone system itself, which is developed by VoxAge.</li>

            <p>After a few months of development of HE:labs and VoxAge, set up equipment and telecom infrastructure activated, the big moment arrived: the first customer!</p>

            <p>The feedback after the test drive with Luz.vc, a consultancy for small businesses, has been super positive. “Very good! Very simple. And fast!” That last word made ​​a difference. The team realized that simplicity brought quickly in a process that is usually very slow.</p>

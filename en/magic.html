      <h3>Monday</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Client idea</h4>
          The first time we meet, both client and team speak about the project and visions in the short and long term.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Wireframe sketching</h4>
          Client and team sketch each page as they imagine how the project should be developed.
          <div class="hide-content">
            <a class="show-more" title="Learn more about wireframe sketching!"><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i></a>
            <div class="show-content">
              <p>The objetive of this stage is to extract everyone's main ideas (client and team) and through communication, come to an agreement of what needs to get done.</p>
              <p>When we speak of wireframe sketching, we literally mean a drawing of what you imagine your interface to be. A simple, pen and paper drawing. <a href="/pdfs/exemplo-de-desenho.pdf" target="_blank">Check out an example!</a></p>
              <div class="modalEntry">
                <p><strong>1.</strong> Everyone from our team and the client sketches, individually, the interfaces as imagined;</p>
                <p><strong>2.</strong> The sketches should reflect the application's flow. How users should interact with the application, which elements must exist and things of that kind;</p>
                <p><strong>3.</strong> Everyone presents their sketches and there's a discussion regarding the best wireframes;</p>
                <p><strong>4.</strong> Criation of a final sketch, which becomes the delivery for the next fase.</p>
              </div>

          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Breaking stories into tasks and estimating</h4>
          The team disolves the final sketch in design and programming tasks, where each team member attributes his or her own estimate.
          <div class="hide-content">
            <a class="show-more" title="Learn more about wireframe sketching!"><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i></a>
            <div class="show-content">
              <p>The main objetive here is to find out what and how much effort is necessary for your development.</p>
              <div class="modalEntry">
                <p><strong>1.</strong> After the team discusses the wifreframes, we create a step-by-step walkthrough for each wireframe. We call these "user stories"
                  where inside each, there are a bunch of tasks;</p>
                <p><strong>2.</strong> In the room where we works, we use drawing boards to list or draw all of the necessary components to create each wireframe (data models, etc);</p>
                <p><strong>3.</strong> Each task has x points. Everyone on the team stipulates how much points they think the task is worth;</p>
                <p><strong>4.</strong> The points used are always 1, 2, 4 or 8, which represent the team's effort in relation to a user story;</p>

        <h4>Prioritizing the tasks</h4>
          The client prioritizes the tasks that will get executed that week.

            <div class="show-content">
              <p>After knowing the effort for each task, it's time to prioritize them and define which are the most important to get done for that week.</p>
              <div class="modalEntry">
                <p><strong>1.</strong> The client re-arranges the tasks in order of most to least important, regardless of effort;</p>
                <p><strong>2.</strong> The team helps the client prioritize, pointing out complexities of each of the tasks at hand;</p>
                <p><strong>3.</strong> The client prioritizes an average of 30 points per person on the team. For example: a team with 2 people would
                deliver approximately 60 points;</p>
                <p><strong>4.</strong> At the end of estimating, client and team know what will be developed during the week;</p>

                <p><strong>3.</strong> Don't worry! Your team will be having fun developing your project while eating snacks and drinking Red Bull;</p>

          <h4>Testing Environment</h4>
          
          The project becomes accessible for testing by the client at a pre-production environment.

            <div class="show-content">
              <p>All projects have a testing environment, called staging. Staging works online so that client and the team executes their tests on an environment that's as
              most up-to-date as possible to what's on production.</p>
              <div class="modalEntry">

              <p>The team utilizes a range of best practices: automated-testing, 100% coverage and continuous integration.</p>
              <div class="modalEntry">
                <p><strong>1.</strong> Each line of code has been executed at least once in order to guarantee its functionality. In this way, new functionalities do not 
                  affect old ones;</p>
                <p><strong>2.</strong> We have to test everything! After this, we 100% guarantee we'll cover your tests. In other words, there won't be one single line of code that has not been tested;</p>
                <p><strong>3.</strong> Every small portion of code that is developed is sent to the staging environment, a process that happens multiple times per day, guaranteeing there is no surprises on your production environment.</p>
